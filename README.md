# Methods Project - Statistical and Machine Learning Methods

This repository contains my project notebook for a statistical methods course, where I implemented and compared various machine learning models on classification and regression tasks. The project focuses on analyzing real-world datasets using theoretical concepts from statistics and machine learning.

## Topics Covered

- Data exploration and visualization
- Data preprocessing
- Model training and evaluation
- Performance comparison between:
  - Linear Regression
  - Logistic Regression
  - k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)
  - Decision Trees
  - Naive Bayes
  - Cross-validation
  - Confusion Matrix Analysis

## Contents

- `Darshil_Shukla_Methods_Project.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook with all analysis, code, and visualizations.
- Plots and performance summaries for each algorithm.
- Conclusions and insights from comparative model performance.

## Datasets Used

- Regression dataset for predicting continuous variables using linear regression.
- Classification dataset for predicting class labels using multiple classifiers.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries:
  - pandas
  - numpy
  - matplotlib
  - seaborn
  - scikit-learn

To install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
